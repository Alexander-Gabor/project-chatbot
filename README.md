## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

Keeping track of the eventListeners and controlling the input at all different points was quite challenging, but also got fun the more I dug deeped into it.
